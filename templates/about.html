                    This application uses machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of post-operative 
                    complications for thoracic cancer surgery patients. The system analyzes various patient 
                    parameters to provide a personalized risk assessment.

                    The primary goal is to assist thoracic surgeons and oncologists in making informed decisions 
                    about patient care, surgical approaches, and post-operative management strategies.

                <p>
                    The model is trained on the Thoracic Surgery Dataset, which contains real patient 
                    data collected from post-operative thoracic surgery patients. The dataset includes 
                    various clinical parameters and outcomes.

                    Post-operative complications following thoracic cancer surgery can significantly impact 
                    patient outcomes and quality of life. By predicting these risks before surgery, 
                    clinicians can:

                <ul>
                    <li>Implement targeted pre-operative optimization strategies</li>
